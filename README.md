# Image-classifier-using-VGG19-on-CIFAR10
The classifier developed uses the VGG19 model to classify CIFAR10 dataset into relevant distinct classes. During training, a loss versus epoch curve was plotted to monitor the training and validation progress. To prevent overfitting, the model was saved based on the lowest validation dataset loss achieved during training.
